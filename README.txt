Social Oracle is the best social proof and upselling tool for any website. The #1 social proof, live orders and sales tool. Sell more products to customers and build trust with visitors.

== Description ==
Almost 80% of visitors leave your store without making a purchase. Often the root of that issue is lack of trust. Visitors never convert because they don’t trust your store and with good reason, they don’t have a reason to.

Think about it: How often do you purchase products online, not sold on Amazon or Ebay? Probably not very often. Most people don’t. That is why Google searches like: “Is STORE NAME legit?” are so popular.

# How do you get visitors to trust you?

The answer is really simple - using social proof.

# What is social proof?

Social proof is a psychological phenomena that leverages the fact that we as social creatures often copy the actions of others. For example, when somebody recommends a certain brand of product that you are already interested in, you will most probably try that certain brand. At least once.

# Why do you need social proof?

Since new visitors don’t trust your store, show them that other people already trust you. By adding social proof to your website, you will have control over how you are perceived. In the end it is a lot more likely for cold leads to convert into paying customers.



== Features ==
Show people social proof via recent orders, total orders, live visitor count, recent visitor count.
Recommend visitors extra products to purchase when they click on “Add To Cart”.
Display real time pop-ups about orders and sales.
Increase conversions and generate more revenue by showing visitors what other people have already purchased via clickable links.
Add your own branding, make the notification match your store.
